## Project Purpose
This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure of a website in Html5, Css3, TailwindCss, DaisyUi, ReactJs, Firebase, MongoDb, ExpressJs, Nodemon, JsonWebToken(JWT), react Query, Toastify, DayPicker, DateFNS and Custom Hooks . It serves as my full length project started from figma file. Since this project was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources as i could with the exception of debugging some js features such as the broken Dashboard. And assistance with nested Routes.

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i needed to work on.

### Working Solution
The above solution was Developed by as strong as possible. If web site is security concern i will fix it, And I will learn from it.

## Additional Challenges
Booking Appointment has been difficult because i had recently started learning Booking. Therefore it took me long to learn the parent-child method in Query. I am still not an expert at query, however, now i can execute query better than now.

## Final thoughts

This project was not easy at all and the longer i worked on it, the more it took out of me. I started strong and i burnt out 80% through. With that being said, it has also been my favourite project so far because i did not rely fully on google to complete it. I only used google to understand smaller concepts and not full sections.
